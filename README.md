# modular-opengl-3d-scene
A modular C++ OpenGL 3D scene recreating a real-world desk environment, featuring low-polygon models, projected textures, Phong shading, multi-light configuration, and interactive camera navigation.

1. How do I approach designing software?
   What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

       I learned to break down a complex scene into single manageable components by building each object individually before connecting them.
       This process sharpened my understanding of encapsulation, scope control, and separation of concerns in a hands on way.

   What design process did you follow for your project work?

       The design process I followed was to build, test, refine. I constructed each object, checked proportions and transformations, then adjusted.
       As the scene grew, I placed each object into their own files which made iteration and debugging easier and cleaner.

   How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

        I will improve readability, debugging, and scalibilty with my future back end development by placing problems into isolated components and solving from there.

3. How do I approach developing programs?
   What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

        I moved away from hardcoded values within functions to utilizing modularity within my code. This can be done by externalizing constants, separating logic into object files,
        and using loops to handle repeated elements instead of placing them manually.

   How did iteration factor into your development?

        Iteration was important in the development in this project. Lighting, materials, and positioning objects required multiple passes. Small numerical changes had real
        visual impact, which reinforced the value of incrimental testing throughout the project.

   How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

        Early milestones were about learning different ways we could impact a scene in OpenGL that ties into the final project. The final project
        was where I was able to focus how things are built. I was able to improve structure and write code that someone else could actually read and build upon.

5. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

       This project helped me further my understanding of OOP programming design, rendering a 3D scene, and how data moves through a complex system.
       This course gave me more experience to write better code for more advanced coursework or working on real world projects.

   How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

       The skills learned in this class, modularity, structured debugging, iteration, and performance awareness, apply all throughout different areas of software development.
       This project pushed me to write cleaner, more intentional code and reinforced the engineering mindset I want to carry into my career.
